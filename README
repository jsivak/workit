Workit is a blatant rip off of Doug Hellmann's virtualenv wrapper:
http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/

I just wanted something that wasn't wrapped out virtualenv since most of my
projects are PHP or other type things. 

The nice thing is that it allows you to setup a postactivate command which can
setup your environment for you. Below is a sample postactivate script which
performs several actions upon getting into the project. 

$ workit someproject

#! /bin/zsh

# variables needed for some script
export JS_PATH="$PROJ_PATH/src";

# define a custom function we can use to launch tests
qunit() { chrome "http://project/javascript/tests/runtests.html" }

# run ctags so vim is up to date when we start working on a project
ctags -f $PROJ_PATH/tags -R $PROJ_PATH/src 2> /dev/null &!

# use the reusable methods for start/stop serives. This project shuts down mysql
# and starts up pgsql for use
zmysql_stop
zpgsql_start
